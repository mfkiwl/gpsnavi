**Only guidance not auto-pilot (yet)**

**Only CUI not GUI**

**Only straight line not curve** 

**Only 2D field not 3D**

BUT

**Any Tablet/Smartphone(windows,android,iOS..)　can use,** because it's used only VNC(Virtual Network Computing)Viewer and 3G/LTE tethering.Everything is calculated on Raspberry Pi.

**No USB port need.You can use for charge**

AND

**Software costs are free!!**
**You can change as you like**
